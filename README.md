# Crossword Puzzle Loader and Solver

## Overview
This project introduces a Python-based tool designed to load, interact with, and solve crossword puzzles stored in CSV files. It aims to assist crossword enthusiasts in solving puzzles through automated hints and solutions, while also providing functionalities for manually entering guesses and checking for errors. The tool's interface is built to be intuitive, leveraging command-line interactions for a seamless user experience. It allows users to load puzzles, make guesses, reveal answers, and track their progress towards solving the puzzle.

## Features

### Puzzle Loading
- **CSV Format Support**: Load crossword puzzles from CSV files, which should contain columns for clue descriptions, answers, starting positions, and orientations (across or down). This feature automates the initial setup of the puzzle, ensuring a quick start to solving.
- **Error Checking**: Robust error handling during the loading process to manage common issues like missing files, incorrect formats, or corrupted data, ensuring reliability and stability.

### Interactive Solving Interface
- **Command-Line Interaction**: Users interact with the crossword puzzle through a simple, intuitive command-line interface. This approach makes the tool accessible to users familiar with basic terminal commands and improves the focus on puzzle solving without the distractions of a graphical interface.
- **Real-Time Updates**: As guesses are made or answers revealed, the crossword board is updated in real-time to reflect changes, providing immediate visual feedback on the progress of the puzzle.

### Automated Clue Handling
- **Reveal Answers**: At any point, users can choose to reveal the answer for a particular clue, which is useful for checking work or bypassing particularly challenging clues.
- **Hint System**: The tool can indicate the first incorrect letter in a user's guess for a clue, helping to guide the solver toward the correct answer without giving it away entirely.
- **Solution Verification**: After each action, the tool can verify whether the puzzle is completely and correctly solved, allowing solvers to know when they have successfully completed the puzzle.

### Visual Feedback
- **Grid Display**: Displays the crossword grid in a clear format with indices, making it easy to navigate and understand where to input guesses or reveal answers.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The display is dynamically updated after each interaction, showing placeholders, guessed letters, and revealed answers in their respective positions on the grid.

### Clue Management
- **Efficient Clue Retrieval**: Clues are stored in a structured manner that allows quick retrieval and updates, facilitating a responsive user experience during gameplay.
- **Sorted Clue Lists**: Clues are displayed sorted by their position and orientation, making it easier for users to locate the specific clues they are working on.

### Error Handling and User Guidance
- **Input Validation**: The tool includes extensive checks for user input, ensuring that only valid guesses are processed and that all interactions conform to expected formats (e.g., valid row and column numbers, appropriate clue orientations).
- **Guided Error Messages**: Whenever an input error is detected, the tool provides a specific error message guiding the user on how to correct it. This feature is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience and minimizing frustration during puzzle solving.

### Advanced Features
- **Customizable Settings**: Advanced users can adjust settings such as the number of clues displayed at one time or the format of the crossword grid display, allowing for a personalized puzzle-solving experience.
- **Performance Optimizations**: The tool is optimized for performance, ensuring that even large or complex crossword puzzles are handled efficiently, with minimal delay in loading times or during interactive gameplay.

### Extensible Design
- **Modular Codebase**: The project is structured in a modular fashion, making it easy for developers to add new features or modify existing ones without disrupting the core functionality.
- **Open for Contributions**: The design invites contributions, whether they're additional features, performance improvements, or bug fixes, from the community.
